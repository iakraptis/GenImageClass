The image shows a lighthouse perched atop a rocky cliff overlooking the ocean at dusk. The sky is illuminated with a warm orange hue, and the lighthouse stands tall and proud, its light reflecting off the water below. The bridge leading up to the lighthouse is visible in the foreground, adding to the beauty of the scene.
