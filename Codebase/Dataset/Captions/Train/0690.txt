The image shows freshly-baked chocolate chip cookies on a marble surface. The cookies are golden-brown in color and have a slightly crisp texture. They are arranged in a neat pattern, with some of them overlapping each other. The marble surface provides a stark contrast to the warm colors of the cookies, making them stand out even more.
